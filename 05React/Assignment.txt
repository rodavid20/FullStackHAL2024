Create a simple React application to display a list of favorite movies. The application should include the following features:

Create and Nest Components: Create a parent component called MovieApp and a child component called MovieList.

Writing Markup with JSX: Use JSX to structure the HTML within the components.

Adding Styles: Apply some basic CSS styles to the components.

Displaying Data: Display a list of movies using an array of movie objects. Each movie object should have a title and a release year.

Conditional Rendering: Display a message "No movies to display" if the movie list is empty.

Rendering Lists: Render the list of movies using the map function.

Responding to Events: Add a button to each movie entry that allows the user to remove the movie from the list.

Updating the Screen: Ensure the screen updates automatically when a movie is removed.
